    <h1>Self Destruct Messenger</h1>
    <p>
      Got messages that are sensitive? Do you like more stress in your life?
      Want to test your memory? Just want to feel like a secret agent for once in your
      life?
    </p>
    <p> Then use the Self Destruct Messgenger. Post messages for yourself or other viewers. Every time
      a user views the message, a counter ticks off. Once the counter gets to 4, BOOM no more message.
    </p>

      <h2>POST a Message</h2>
      <p>
        To create a new message, make a POST request to "api/messages" that contains a JSON object
        with the following key-values (the values are the value type):
      </p>
<pre>
{"oneWordTitle": String, "oneWordTitle": String, "secretToRead": String, "priority": Number}
</pre>

      <h2>GET All Messages</h2>
      <p>
        To see all available messages, make a GET request to "api/messages".
      </p>
      <p>
        NOTE: Viewing a message title in this way does not contribute to or destory a message.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>GET Your Message</h2>
      <p>To view your desired message, make a GET request to "api/{oneWordTitle}" where {oneWordTitle}
        is the oneWordTitle of the message you would like to view.
      </p>
      <p>
        NOTE: Viewing a message this way causes a message to either increase count towards or to self destruct.
        Every time you view a message you will receive a console log that tells you how many views you have left.
